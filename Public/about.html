                <p>Have you ever been bored while attending one of your CS classes and said to yourself: "I wish I could play a game that tests my intellect and proves that I have a better memory than all my friends." 
                    Flip is a card memory game that tests your ability to remember symbols and their locations. Flip also tracks your performance and posts the best scores on a public leaderboard 
                    in order to compete with your friends and satisfy your competitive itch.</p>
